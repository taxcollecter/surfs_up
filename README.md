# Surfs Up

## Overview of  Weather analysis
In seeking backing in investment of our Surf and Shake shop, we've been asked to perform an analysis on the Weather of the island of Oahu. Specifically the months of June and December when tourism is at its peak. This analysis has been requested to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results
In reviewing the temperature data provided by W. Avy, leveraging 3000+ data points, we determined that Oahu's weather in June DOES NOT vary much from that of December
  - The avg Temp in June is 74.94 degrees in December the avg Temp is 71.04 degrees
  - Of 1700 data points, the min Temp in June is 64 degrees. Of 1517 data points, the min Temp in December is 56 degrees.
  - Of 1700 data points, the max Temp in June is 85 degrees. Of 1517 data points, the min Temp in December is 83 degrees.

## Weather Analysis Summary
While this script can be used to successfully audit the turnout of our local elections, we also would like to propose enhancing the program to identify WHERE each candidate's support comes from by County. Doing so will highlight each candidates performance from a geographical pespective and underscore our auditing activities. From an intergrity perspective we would also propose adding additional years of data to the supporting dataset to track historical turnout over time. Doing so will expose outliers in turnout and identify any potential issues with voting integrity.
